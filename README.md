**This program provides a foundational understanding of building an AI chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) by using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. The key lesson here is how to build a simple chatbot that can respond to user inputs based on pre-defined responses, by evaluating the similarity between the user's input and a set of training sentences. The program utilizes the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to transform the sentences into numerical vectors that capture the importance of words in the context of the corpus. It then calculates the cosine similarity between the user's input vector and the preprocessed vectors of the training data (corpus). Cosine similarity measures the degree of similarity between two vectors, which is used to find the most similar sentence in the corpus to the user's query. Based on this, the chatbot selects an appropriate response from a list of pre-defined answers. This demonstrates how basic NLP techniques such as text vectorization and similarity measurement can be used to create a simple yet functional conversational model.**
